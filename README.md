# utensor-mnist-demo-F429ZI
This is forked version of u-tensor demo example that is originally written for DISCO-F413ZH board from u-tensor official repository.

This example is modified for DISCO-F429ZI that has less SRAM than F413ZH Hence the F413ZH version crashes due to less RAM available. 
Goal is to be able to write tensors to external SDRAM provided on DISCO-F429ZI and successfully run the demo on DISCO-F429ZI.
